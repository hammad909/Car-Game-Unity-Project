How It Works

Car Selection Logic:

Cars are loaded from a predefined list or database.

Players can browse available cars and view details.

In-Game Currency Management:

The player starts with a fixed amount of in-game currency.

The balance decreases upon purchasing a car.

The game prevents purchases if the balance is insufficient.

Validation and Feedback:

On attempting to purchase a car, the game validates the player's balance.

Success and error messages are displayed based on the outcome.

Customization

Modify the car list in the src/car_selection directory to add new cars.

Adjust the starting in-game balance in the src/currency module.

Update the UI design by editing files in the src/ui directory.
